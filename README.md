# P1-Build-a-Portfolio-Site
Project Overview

You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the
portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and
making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own!
